# NewYearsCards v0.2.0 (2025-12-04)

A focused release that delivers a working CLI, address processing pipeline, and a comprehensive test suite. It also relocates documentation into `docs/` and streamlines runtime dependencies.

## Highlights
- New CLI `newyearscards` with `download` and `build-labels` commands
- End‑to‑end address formatting from raw Google Sheet → mail‑merge CSV
- Extensive tests for URL parsing, transformation, and CLI
- Documentation moved to `docs/` and aligned with actual behavior

## Added
- Comprehensive unit tests covering address processing, Sheets URL parsing, and CLI
- `--dry-run` for `build-labels` to preview output without writing files
- Console script wiring in `pyproject.toml` (entry `newyearscards`)
- Core modules: `sheets.py`, `addresses.py`, and `config.py`

## Changed
- Moved non-essential documentation into `docs/` and updated references in README
- README and workflow documentation aligned with actual CLI behavior
- Lazy-load Google auth in downloader to avoid unnecessary runtime deps for non-download commands

## Usage
- Download latest sheet: `newyearscards download --year 2025`
- Build labels: `newyearscards build-labels --year 2025`
- Dry-run preview: `newyearscards build-labels --input data/raw/2025/mailing_list.csv --dry-run`

If developing locally:
- Install runtime deps: `pip install -e .` (or `uv pip install -e .`)
- Optional dev tools: `pip install -e .[dev]` (adds pytest, mypy)

## Changelog
- See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for the full history.
