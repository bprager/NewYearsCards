### Added
- Developer launcher script `newyearscards` to run CLI without install or PYTHONPATH.
- Makefile targets `run-download` and `run-build` for no‑install usage.
- Ruff configured and added to `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`.

### Changed
- README clarified with correct command invocations:
  - Installed usage, from‑source `python newyearscards ...`, and `uv run` examples.
  - Highlighted `.env` configuration (SHEET_URL required; RAW/PROCESSED dir overrides; ADDRESS_TEMPLATES; SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY).
- Minor CLI cleanup and formatting, tests remain green.
